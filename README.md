### Sources
- I used the leaflet documentation https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/ when reading more about how to use geoJSON options like "style" and "onEachFeature" and stumbled across "pointToLayer" with the use of circleMarker to help build the code from line 33-55 of the code in Leaflet-Part-1.

- I also used chatgpt to help me refine the css code for the legend because I didn't know how to fix it as I am not familiar with css.

Thank you.
